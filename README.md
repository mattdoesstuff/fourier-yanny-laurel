# fourier-yanny-laurel
A Linear Algebra final project on manipulating the Yanny/Laurel audio illusion using Fourier Transformations.

We used Numpy's Fourier Transform to figure out the wavelength corresponding to each sound illusion, graphing heatmaps, and reversing it to produce Yanny and Laurel sounds individually
